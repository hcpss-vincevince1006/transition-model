  <h1>Model for Transition in Howard County</h1>

<section class="contents callout-border-prim smtb-mg">
<h2>What is Transition Planning?</h2>
  <p>Transition planning is the process of preparing students for adult life after graduation from an HCPSS school.</p>
</section>

<section class="contents section__breakout--full-rounded smtb-mg">

<div class="col-left">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Preparation for adult life begins as soon as a student enters an HCPSS school. This includes giving all HCPSS students the same expectations for individual growth, while providing unique transition activities and experiences to support students with disabilities.</p>

<p>At each level of their education, students with disabilities are supported by both their school community and parents to successfully transition into adult, independent living. </p>

</div>
 
<div class="col-right">
<h2>General Expectations</h2>
<h3>Elementary school</h3>
	<p><strong>Parents will be introduced to the IEP and transition process</strong> and gain a better understanding of their student's individual needs. This builds the foundation for their future transition plan.</p>
<h3>Middle School</h3> 
	<p><strong>Parents begin the formal transition planning process</strong> and complete a Positive Personal Profile. Students will start coming up with their post-secondary goals and parents can start applying for appropriate post-secondary adult services.</p>
<h3>High School</h3>
	<p><strong>Formal transition planning continues at this level.</strong> Parents and the school will come up with a career pathway that is aligned with the student's interest and ability levels. Students will take advantage of either workplace learning experiences or college readiness resources.</p>
